  **Learning About CSS Selectors**


  CSS selectors are used to select and style HTML elements. Understanding how to
  use them effectively is crucial for designing web pages. Here are some basic
  types of CSS selectors:


  - **Element Selector**: Selects all elements of a given type.  
    Example: `p { color: blue; }` selects all `<p>` elements.

  - **Class Selector**: Selects elements with a specific class attribute.  
    Example: `.classname { font-size: 14px; }` selects all elements with `class="classname"`.

  - **ID Selector**: Selects a single element with a specific ID.  
    Example: `#unique { margin: 10px; }` selects the element with `id="unique"`.

  - **Attribute Selector**: Selects elements based on an attribute or attribute
  value.  
    Example: `[type="text"] { border: 1px solid black; }` selects all `<input>` elements with `type="text"`.

  - **Pseudo-class Selector**: Selects elements based on their state or
  position.  
    Example: `a:hover { color: red; }` changes the color of links when hovered over.

  Understanding these selectors will help you apply styles to your web pages
  more effectively.
