  # Using Headers in HTML


  HTML headers are used to define the headings of a webpage. They range from
  `<h1>` to `<h6>`, with `<h1>` being the highest level and `<h6>` the lowest.
  Here's a brief overview:


  - `<h1>`: Main heading, used for the most important title.

  - `<h2>`: Subheading, used for sections.

  - `<h3>`: Sub-subheading, used for subsections.

  - `<h4>` to `<h6>`: Used for further subdivisions.


  Example usage in HTML:


  ```html

  <h1>Main Title</h1>

  <h2>Section Title</h2>

  <h3>Subsection Title</h3>

  ```


  Using headers correctly helps with SEO and accessibility, as they provide
  structure to your content.
